INTRUCTIONS
-For the Cake:
-Butter and flour 3 eight inch cake pans. I highly recommend using cake strips for a more even bake.
-Sift together the dry ingredients (including the sugar) into the bowl of a stand mixer and whisk to combine.
-Add the wet ingredients into a large bowl and whisk together.
-Add the wet ingredients the dry ingredients. 
-Whisk to combine then mix on low for about a minute.
-Distribute batter evenly to the three pans and bake for about 35-40 minutes at 350F (176C) or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. I recommend rotating the pans halfway through the bake.
-Allow time to cool for 10 minutes then invert onto wire racks to cool fully.
-For the Chocolate Buttercream:
-In a small bowl combine the semi-sweet chocolate with 2 tbs of cream then microwave for 40 secs on half power. Stir to combine then set aside. 
-Whip the butter for about 2 minutes using a paddle attachment (in a stand-up mixer).
-Add the ¼ cup of cocoa powder, and the salt then mix to combine.
-Scrape the bowl down and beat in the confectioner’s sugar slowly.
-Beat in the cream. You may add the optional vanilla and espresso at this step. 
-Mix until you have a nice, even consistency.
-Beat in the melted and cooled chocolate ganache.
